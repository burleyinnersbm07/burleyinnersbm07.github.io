				<div class="projectDiv">
					<h4>Falling Skies</h4>
					<p><a href="https://github.com/burleyinnersbm07/fallingSkies" target="_blank">GitHub!</a></p>
					<p>I wanted to learn Python, the problem I had was that all of my freetime was going into classwork, my job, creating a half-decent resume, going to gym, and everything else. So, for my business programming concepts class, part of the curriculum was creating some kind of material that would benefit the public or attract people to the computer science department. Everyone likes games, right? So, why not create one?</p>
					<p>The project was simple: Our group would take a Raspberry Pi, make a few games in Python, and put them on display in the hallways for people to play between classes. I enjoyed the project quite a lot because it was a whole new challenge for me. I had never even attempted to make a game before (and this one wasn't all that complicated by comparison to the games that are on the market today!). So, I created the game with Python 2.4.10 and the PyGame library. As it stands, it is part of a menu, but downloading the whole .zip and running it should let you play the game. ... The goal is to avoid the falling stuff. Have fun!</p>
				</div>
				<div class="projectDiv">
					<h4>JSP's</h4>
					<p>I've made two websites using the MVC framework. Both projects are built in Java, so they utilize JSP and Servlets, but they also pull data from a database, SQLite in this case, so there's some JDBC work going on in there too. Both projects are similar, but <a href="https://github.com/burleyinnersbm07/droptablesJSP" target="_blank">Bug Tracker</a> is more functional in that it serves as a real-world application as program to track glitches and issues with the Python games we developed in another project. <a href="https://github.com/burleyinnersbm07/RestaurantReservations" target="_blank">Restaurant Reservations</a> is a simple MVC project as well, but provides the user with a less-friendly display.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="projectDiv">
					<h4>SNAKE</h4>
					<p><a href="https://github.com/burleyinnersbm07/pythonSnakeGame" target="_blank">GitHub!</a></p>
					<p>This was the first game I made and it taught me a lot. It's complete in that you can certainly play the game. However, it lacks some aesthetic touches that I would like, as well as a score counter. It follows the same design as 'Falling Skies'.</p>
